REGEN_PROMPT.txt
================

Purpose:
Recreate the GH100-FlashCard application using the stable FULL-FIX baseline.
Use this prompt whenever regenerating the app to avoid file-mixing errors.

--- COPY FROM BELOW ---

Create a complete static GitHub Pages PWA flashcard app (no build tools) from my attached DOCX.

INPUT
- File: GH-100 GitHub Admin Cert Exam QnA.docx
- Correct answers are the options highlighted in yellow.

OUTPUT
- Provide a ZIP containing ONLY these files at repo root:
  index.html
  styles.css
  app.js
  cards.json
  service-worker.js
  manifest.json
  icons/icon-192.png
  icons/icon-512.png
  README.md

STRICT RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- index.html MUST contain HTML only (no JSON).
- app.js MUST contain JavaScript only (no JSON).
- cards.json MUST contain data-only JSON (no JavaScript, no comments).
- All paths must be relative so it works under https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/

APP FEATURES (match FULL-FIX baseline)
- Mobile-friendly dark UI with flip-card animation.
- Bottom controls layout:
  Prev / Flip (or Reveal) / Submit (quiz mode) / Next
  ABOVE: “I got it / I missed”.
- Toggles:
  Shuffle questions
  Shuffle answers (reshuffle on navigation)
  Only missed
  Quiz mode
- Quiz mode behaviour:
  - Single-answer: auto-submit on tap
  - Multi-answer: require Submit button
  - Show correct / incorrect feedback
- Track progress in localStorage (correct / wrong counts).
- “Only missed” shows cards with wrong > 0.

PWA / DEPLOYMENT
- Include service-worker with SKIP_WAITING support.
- Include update banner: “New version available” + Refresh button.
- Bump CACHE_NAME in service-worker.js on every regeneration.
