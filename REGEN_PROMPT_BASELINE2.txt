REGEN_PROMPT_BASELINE2.txt
========================

Purpose
- Rebuild **GH100-FlashCard — Baseline No. 2** (Multi-deck + mobile bottom row icons + 2-row toolbar icons).

Baseline characteristics (for reference)
- Multi-deck via `decks.json` loading `cards.json` (main) + `hard.json` (hard deck).
- Mobile bottom controls are forced into ONE row and use icons:
  ◀  👁  ✅  ▶
- Mobile toolbar (Shuffle Q/A, Only missed, Quiz, Reset) is in 2 rows and uses icons:
  🔀Q  🔀A  ❌
  📝  ♻️
- PWA with update banner + service worker SKIP_WAITING.
- GitHub Pages compatible (project site under /<repo>/, relative paths only).
